    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
      Male, 33 and IT generalist. Employed at a global corporate developing and
      improving digital work environments for our business processes. In my free
      time I like to play golf and do more stuff with computers.
    </p>
    <h3>My blog</h3>
    <p>
      I learned a lot about computer tech from the internet. So I would like to
      contribute by writing about my own real life computer stuff and how I deal
      with its problems. May the solutions I found be of any help to others!
    </p>
    <h3>Web developing</h3>
    <p>
      I started to develop static websites and web applications for friends and
      family as a hobby. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I can
      build simple applications with React. The website you are currently
      reading is built with my own implementation of Gatsby.
